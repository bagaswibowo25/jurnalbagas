        <h1 id="hello">Hello</h1>
<p>My name is <strong>Bagas Ari Wibowo</strong>, my friends call me Bagas, now I work as an engineer and in this platform I try to write and share notes while I work as an engineer.</p>
<h1 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h1>
<p>Every story begins with an opening, first I would like to thank the readers who have visited this page and I hope that what is written can be understood and taken advantage of.</p>
<p>I want to try to write down everything that I have been through during my career as an engineer and the beginning of becoming an engineer and the journey process up to this point.</p>
<p>This page not the first page that I build, before I already had a personal blog but it seems I want to <em><strong>reboot</strong></em> the contents of the blog, whether it&rsquo;s content or writing in it and this is my starting point to start writing my new career story. started and that I have been through the past few years.</p>
<p>I started my career in the &ldquo;IT&rdquo; world since 2019, which is relatively new. Yes, I&rsquo;m writing this in 2022, now I&rsquo;m only 20 years old where I feel like all new things are about to begin. Before my career I want to share a little bit of my short experience.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>I started to learn more about &ldquo;IT&rdquo; when I was in SMK. At that time I chose the major &ldquo;Computer and Network Engineering&rdquo;. From there, I learned a lot and participated in activities that really helped me to be ready to the point where I started my career as an engineer.</p>
<p>I got a lot of experience during the 3 years of schooling at SMK. I participated in several <em>events</em> competitions that helped me gain experience and became the capital of my experience after graduating from school to work.</p>
<p>Participating in competitions is part of my journey. I followed some of the <em>events</em> that I went through when I was in school:</p>
<ul>
<li>LKS SMK Tingkat Kab. Bogor (October 2018)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/page/lks-kab.jpg" alt="lks-smk-bogor"></p>
<ul>
<li>LKS SMK Province West Java (October 2018)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/page/lks-prov.jpeg" alt="lks-smk-jabar"></p>
<ul>
<li>IT Expo UNJ (November 2018)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/page/it-expo-unj.jpeg" alt="it-expo-unj"></p>
<ul>
<li>Selekda Jawa Barat (April 2019)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/page/selekda-jabar.jpg" alt="selekda-jabar"></p>
<ul>
<li>LKS National (July 2019)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/page/lks-nasional.jpg" alt="lks-nasional"></p>
<ul>
<li>Seleknas (August 2019)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/page/seleknas.jpg" alt="seleknas"></p>
<p>From the journey above, there have been many ups and downs. Many people have <em>supported</em> during the whole process. Maybe I&rsquo;ll tell you in more detail in the gallery post later. In addition to school like other students, I also participate in school organizations. There I got a lot of extraordinary experiences and opportunities. I&rsquo;ll tell you a little below.</p>
<p>I am currently studying at Bina Nusantara University, majoring in <em>Computer Science</em> because I want to continue my previous education.</p>
<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>
<p>This is where I found friends, experiences, and opportunities to become who I am today. I am very grateful to be able to pass the school period by joining this organization. Previously I had never joined the organization. Here I am not only learning for myself but also learning to share what I have learned.</p>
<p><img src="/page/nevtik.jpg" alt="nevtik"></p>
<h2 id="carier">Carier</h2>
<p>My career started at the beginning of the 3rd quarter around August 2019. After graduating from school and armed with experience in organizations and schools I tried to start a career. After that I started working as <em><strong>System Administrator</strong></em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>System Administrator - PT Lamjaya Global Solusi (August 2019 - March 2021)</p>
<p>Here I get a new experience about the real world of work, very different from the practice that was done during school, but quite adaptable for the technical side because of the practice that is often done at school.</p>
<p>After a year of career I also stepped up to start further education as a student. I decided to study online at Bina Nusantara Online Learning University because I wanted to continue my career.</p>
<p>There I got a lot of new experiences, starting from working on projects, research, implementation, and preparing all client needs. There I work with <em>developers</em> to help test and deploy applications.</p>
<p>After going through the pandemic period that started in 2020, boredom and discomfort began to occur at work. I started looking for new job opportunities in a different field from that time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud Engineer - PT Boer Technology (March 2021 - Present)</p>
<p>In early 2021, after I looked for work opportunities elsewhere, I got the opportunity to work as a <em>Cloud Engineer</em>. Starting a new field here is the time to explore new things that I have never discovered before.</p>
</li>
</ul>
